Object Detection with YOLOv8
This project implements real-time and offline object detection using the YOLOv8 model. It supports detection from live camera feeds, uploaded videos, and static images.

Features
YOLOv8-based Object Detection
Leveraging the powerful YOLOv8 model for fast and accurate object detection.

Live Camera Detection
Detect objects in real-time using your deviceâ€™s camera.

Video Upload Detection
Upload a video file and perform object detection frame by frame.

Image Upload Detection
Upload a static image and run object detection.

Performance
Achieved 80% accuracy on the test dataset for image detection.
